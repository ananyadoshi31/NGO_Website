                            We take the utmost care to process donations as per the instructions given by our donors, online and offline. However, in case of an unlikely event of an erroneous donation, we will respond to the donor within 7 working days of receiving a valid request for refund from the donor.

The timely refund of the donation will depend upon the type of credit card/banking instrument used during the transaction. The donor will have to send us a written request for a refund within 2 days of making the donation along with the proof of the deduction of the donation amount.

In cases where the donation receipt has already been issued to the donor, the donor will have to return the original receipt to us at our office address.

If the tax exemption certificate is already issued, then we are sorry but we will not be able to refund the donation. However, in case of a valid refund request due to any error on our part, we will refund the donation and bear the costs of the same. If the donor doesn’t write within two days, then refund is not possible.
